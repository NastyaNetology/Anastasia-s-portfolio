# About

Hi, I'm Anastasia!

I hold a Master’s degree in Software Engineering from Germany and have over five years of experience as a Business Analyst. Throughout my career, I’ve built a strong foundation in data analysis and developed a deep passion for leveraging AI and machine learning to improve efficiency and uncover meaningful insights from data.

My professional journey has equipped me with expertise in:

- Data analysis
- System architecture design
- Business process optimization

During my studies, I gained hands-on experience with advanced technologies including machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI. I’ve applied these tools to develop data-driven solutions aligned with real business needs. I believe this technical foundation will be a valuable asset in my role as a Senior Business Analyst with a strong technical background.
